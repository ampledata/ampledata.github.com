Me, 30 minutes ago.

# The Deal
- I want to create articles of ideas using vim.
- I want to write these articles in Markdown format.
- I want to include code snippets in these articles.
- I want these code snippets to include syntax highlighting.

# How
1. By whatever means, download the contents of this directory.
2. Install the prerequisite Python Modules and generate some CSS.
3. Write an article and render it into HTML.
4. Publish.

As seen from the command line:

    :::bash
    git clone https://github.com/ampledata/ampledata.github.com.git
    cd ampledata.github.com
    ./install.sh
    ./make.py
