Me, 30 minutes ago.

# The Deal
- I want to create articles of ideas using vim.
- I want to write these articles in Markdown format.
- I want to include code snippets in these articles.
- I want these code snippets to include syntax highlighting.

# How
<ol>
<li>By whatever means, download the contents of this directory.</li>
<li>Install the prerequisite Python Modules and generate some CSS:</li>

    :::bash
    ./install.sh

<li>Write an article and render it into HTML:</li>

    :::bash
    ./make.py

<li>Publish.</li>
</ol>
