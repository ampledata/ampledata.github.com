# Abstract
This article describes a method for using a super-small single-board computer ([Raspberry Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi)) as a remote Amateur Radio Terminal Node Controller ([TNC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_node_controller)) for use with Amateur Radio Packet services like Automatic Packet Reporting System ([APRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System)), [Packet Radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_radio), et al.

# Background
Existing TNC technology typically required direct connection between the TNC device and the computer running packet software. For users of Windows, there exists the option to use the [AGWPE](http://www.sv2agw.com/ham/agwpe.htm) software to connect a computer running packet software to a remote Windows computer connected to a TNC.

# Inspiration
The Raspberry Pi single-board computer is an open-source, open-hardware design that allows developers to create easy
