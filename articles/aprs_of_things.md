# Oro Net Concept

This article outlines a proposal to build an Amateur Radio-based telemetry
system using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment. The basis for this
system is the existing APRS network, thus creating an 'APRS of Things'
(see also: 'Internet of Things'). The name for this system is "Oro Net", named
after the motto on San Francisco's flag "Oro en paz. Fierro en guerra.".

This system should allow transmitting stations ("things") to broadcast any
type of message or telemetry from any location at any time and have it
received and delivered to the APRS-IS network. This is accomplished using
numerous receiver stations dispersed in an urban geographic area.

Similar projects:

* ADS-B Receiver Networks.
* AIS Receiver Networks.

Q: Why not use the existing APRS network?
A: The existing APRS network:
* Does not penetrate dense urban environments well.
* Is over subscribed with powerful (5w+) Mobile stations.

Q: Why not build digipeaters instead?
A: Digipeaters would only add to the existing network congestion and would
require an Amateur Radio Operating License, where-as the Oro Net is a
receive-only network, thus requiring no Amateur license.

The basic cost for each Oro Net Node is $88, with a variable range of $74-$120.
