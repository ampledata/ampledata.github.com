# Enhancing Situational Awareness using Ham Radio & TAK

This article describes a project to enhance unit tracking & Situational 
Awareness at the San Francisco Marathon in September 2021. This project 
resulted in the creation of several novel tools and solutions, outlined in 
detail below.

## Background & Motivation

The [San Francisco Marathon](https://www.thesfmarathon.com/) is a yearly foot 
race held in between San Francisco & Marin county Runners can participate in 
races ranging from 5K to Ultramarathon covering a diverse range of 
environments from city to waterfront.

The [San Francisco Radio Club (SFRC)](https://www.sfarc.org/) provides 
communications between 30 first aid & watering stations, 5 SAGs, a 
motorcycle-based Sweep, and other down-range spotters. SAG units are used to 
pickup and delivery racers who cannot continue back to race finish. Tracking 
these units is the responsibility of the SFRC Net Control operators, a task 
accomplished in previous years with a combination of paper maps and 
computer-based APRS.

For the 2021 race an effort was made to fuse multiple disparate unit tracking 
systems into a single pane of glass common operating picture (COP) for display 
at forward event command/ICP.

## Challenges & Solutions

__Geography__

The marathon's geographic footprint covers both dense urban canyons, open 
ocean crossings, and regions in-between. These different environments present 
different signal and location positioning challenges. A myriad of tracking 
devices were used to address these challenges and each unit could carry more 
than one different tracking device. For example, a unit in a larger vehicle 
could cary both an APRS Beacon and a TAK Tracker.

* Solution: Use multiple different tracking systems.

__Common Operating Picture Nomenclature & Visual Communication__

Different position location information (PLI) sources use different unit 
identifying information. Of need for an effective COP is the use of a unified 
nomenclature for units & assets. These"tactical callsigns" can vary by event, 
sponsoring entity and command agency. (Probably covered within NIMS?) 

A particular challenge of these different tracking systems is the disparate 
nomenclature each system uses for tracked units. (e.g. Some systems use verbose 
unit identifiers, others are simple callsigns.) Additionally, regardless of the 
unit name or callsign, the COP may have its own common language & visual 
representation (icon).

* Solution: Add a nomenclature normalization layer.

Additionally, the ability to visually represent unit 'typing' using a common 
reference (icons) aids in disambiguation and communication.

* Solution: Create, apply & utilize a COP icon set.

__Situational Awareness Application Diversity__

There are several Situational Awareness (SA) applications available across 
various form factors and end user devices (EUD). Each SA App adheres to 
different formats & levels of support for PLI Data.

* Solution: Add a PLI data transformation layer.

## Summary

A fusion of multiple different unit tracking systems overcame many of the 
challenges of holding a special event in a diverse and vast geographical 
footprint. Nomenclature normalization and standardization of icons for visual 
representation enhanced SA understanding across organizational units. 

### TAK Tracker

__TAK Tracker Limitations__

- Only uses GPS Location Provider, limiting device location & positioning in 
   GPS Denied environments, such as indoors, underground, or within mobile 
   command centers with metal shielding. 
- Cannot load Data Packages from SD Card physical install media, requiring 
   either download of a data package through an online means (website, etc), 
   or adb file ‘push’ with Android Developer Tools. 
- Data Packages do not support ‘macros’ or name scripting. Callsign must be 
   manually set at install time.

__TAK Tracker Feature Enhancements__

1. Allow auto-configuring using QR codes or deep links.
2. Macro style callsign configuration. E.g. ‘CA-SF-SFM-${IMEI:-4}’
3. Recommend changing TAK Tracker to support FusedLocationProvider.
4. Recommend changing TAK Tracker to allow loading Data Packages from physical 
   install media.
   
__Unexpected Outcome__

TAK Tracker's use of Android GPS Location Provider alone did not present a 
notable unit tracking hindrance. This could be due to all units being either 
outdoors or in moving vehicles, and none being indoors or underground.

### Future Considerations

__Add the CAD incident locations to the COP.__

__Add remote event camera display to the COP.__

## Details

### Multiple Tracking Systems

[![Logical data flow](img/sfm2021/logical_data_diagram_25p.png)](img/sfm2021/logical_data_diagram.png)

Several unit tracking systems were used, each chosen to meet the various 
geographical, signal and location positioning challenges of the event's 
footprint.

1. VHF Ham Radio APRS Beacons
2. [Orion Labs Push-to-Talk smartphone App](https://www.orionlabs.io/)
3. TAK Tracker smartphone App
4. [Garmin inReach satellite location trackers](https://discover.garmin.com/en-US/inreach/personal/)

### Cloud Infrastructure

Two [Google Cloud Computing Servers](https://cloud.google.com/) instances 
were created:

1. CentOS: TAK Server
2. Debian: Docker, node-red, tileserver-gl, ownCloud

### TAK Server & TAK Tracker

TAK Server was utilized as a PLI data destination endpoint for TAK Tracker, 
and a 'transformed' PLI data source for APRS & WinTAK. Individual users were 
auto-enrolled from ATAK & WinTAK. 

A shared certificate was created for TAK Tracker to speed EUD provisioning. 
This certificate was bundled with a ATAK Preferences file into a Data Package 
and loaded onto the EUD using 'adb push' from an Android development 
workstation. Once loaded the TAK Tracker settings UI was used to install the 
Data Package and complete configuration, including updating the the callsign to 
replace the 'XXXX example with the last for digits of the IMEI.

### Node-RED

[![Node-RED Screenshot](img/sfm2021/nodered_screenshot_50p.png)](img/sfm2021/nodered_screenshot.png)

Node-RED was used as a PLI data transformation layer. A Node-RED Flow was 
created to ingest PLI data from different sources and rename or 'normalize' 
the data to fit the COP.

This Node-RED "PLI normalization" Flow added new capabilities over previous 
tracking solutions:

1. A unit could be tracked using one or more different sources
2. Unit nomenclature can be normalized to fit the COP
3. Unit icons can be normalized to fit the COP visual language

__Multiple Sources__

The Node-RED Flow was configured to read PLI data from every tracking system 
and ingest their respective PLI data. Once data was ingested, it could be 
transformed and delivered to other SA Apps in their native PLI data formats.

__Renaming__

[![Name normalization](img/sfm2021/name_normalization_50p.png)](img/sfm2021/name_normalization.png)

The Node-RED Flow's "PLI normalization" capability allowed the transformation 
of a disparate PLI Data and its respective unit identifiers to be normalized to
the COP nomenclature.

As an example, an APRS Beacon could be transmitting to the APRS Network with a 
callsign of 'W2GMD-TAC-09', while an Orion user could be online with the 
username 'Greg A.'. The PLI Normalization Flow can rename each of those to the 
unit identifier 'SAG 2'.

__Icons & Reference Image__ 

[![SAG 2](img/sfm2021/sag_2.png)](img/sfm2021/sag_2.png)

The Node-RED Flow allowed a single reference image to be applied to each unit 
across different SA Apps.  As there was existing COP visual language in use, 
Font Awesome fonts were used a standard reference icons for all SA Apps. A 
Data Package was created for WinTAK & ATAK matching that used by Node-RED 
Worldmap.

### tileserver-gl

[![tileserver-gl screenshot](img/sfm2021/tileserver_screenshot_50p.png)](img/sfm2021/tileserver_screenshot.png)

[tileserver-gl](https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl) was used to deliver 
event map tiles to EUDs. Maps were taken from an event planning PDF and split 
into individual map tiles using mapTiler's desktop tool. tileserver-gl was 
running inside a Docker container on the Google Cloud Instance Debian host.

### Other

Orion utilized the Orion PTT multitenant service & Orion Aster workflow tool.

Garmin utilized the garmin xxx service with a Garmin inReach mini

Smartphones used by TAK Tracker & Orion users were Kyocera DuraForce Pro/Pro2 
and varied between Verizon Public Safety and AT&T FirstNet.

VHF Ham Radio APRS beacons varied.
