	A career is never complete. It's a journey of education. If you give up trying to educate yourself, you've given up your journey.
	
That said, there's many ways you can expand your knowledge of emergency & disaster services. Below I've listed some of the ways you can increase your understanding of these skills.

# Emergency Response

## Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)

I consider CPR the baseline knowledge you should possess if you're interested in helping people in emergency situations. Several organizations teach this skill, some free, some paid.

* [American Safety & Health Institute](http://www.hsi.com/cprtraining)

If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, [Sports Basement](http://community.sportsbasement.com/free-classes/cpr/) even offers free CPR classes.

## First Aid

In addition to teaching CPR, several organizations also teach First Aid classes.

## Emergency Medical Responder (EMR)

Though not a certifiable level of emergency medicine within California, EMR is a federally recognized level of training in emergency medicine. EMR contains much of the same scope of practice as that of the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), expect with a limited instruction time. EMR classes are offered at several San Francisco Bay Area community colleges and offer a range of associated certifications.

** Certifications: 
*** American Red Cross Emergency Response (ER)
*** American Red Cross Bloodborne Pathogens: Preventing Disease Transmission
*** American Red Cross Administering Emergency Oxygen
*** American Red Cross BLS: CPR/AED For the Professional Rescuer and Healthcare Provider
*** California Division of Forestry (CalFire) Emergency Care of the Sick & Injured (Title 22).

## Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)

When you're ready to take emergency medical care seriously, you should consider setting aside a semester of school to take an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) course. This course will familiarize and certify you to care for people as a professional rescuer. This course is also offered at many San Francisco Bay Area colleges, as well as through private training facilities.

* City College of San Francisco's [Health Care Technology-Emergency Medical Technician](http://www.ccsf.edu/NEW/en/educational-programs/school-and-departments/school-of-health-and-physical-education/Healthcaretechnology.html) class.
* San Francisco Paramedic Association [Emergency Medical Technician](http://sfparamedics.org/~sfparame/emergency-medical-technician-emt/) course.

## Wilderness First Responder (WFR)/ Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician (WEMT)

An adjunct for emergency medical skills are the wilderness courses offered by several organizations. These courses will familiarize you with caring for patients in remote regions using local resources.

* National Outdoor Leadership School [Wilderness First Responder](http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/wfr.shtml)
* National Outdoor Leadership School [Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician](http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/wemt.shtml)

## Community Emergency Response Team (CERT)

Called NERT, PANDA, and other things within the Bay Area, CERT is a nationally recognized course in disaster response. This course is offered by most Bay Area municipal governments.

# Adjunct Skills

## Amateur Radio (Ham) License

In times of crisis the most affected ability will be that of communication. Ham Radio operators have the capability and skill to overcome the obstacles of power outages, phone outages, and other communication disasters.
