The following report was compiled using San Francisco Pride Parade 2013 dispatch notes. The purpose of this document is to socialize the scope & weight of providing Emergency Medical Services Dispatch at an event of this magnitude.

# Background

The San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration is a parade and festival held in San Francisco every June. Event organizers were anticipating a record 1.2 million attendies to 2013's Pride event, an increase of 200,000 from the four previous [years](http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/pride-party-is-prepared-for-record-attendance/Content?oid=2151877). 2013's attendance increase was primarily due to recent judicary victories with the repeal of California's Proposition 8 (Prop. 8) and the unconstitutionality of the Federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in the days leading up Pride. Additionally, San Francisco was experiencing exceptionally warm summer weather the weekend of Pride.

Prior to 2013, Pride Emergency Medical Services were provided by volunteers, administered by the 'San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride Celebration Committee' and under their direct control. For 2013 HealthRIGHT360's Rock Medicine program was brought in to administer Emergency Medical Operations using a combination of their volunteers and existing Pride administration volunteers. Rock Med was selected because of its ability to provide Advanced Life Support field care without burdening the existing San Francisco County Emergency Medical System.

# Notes

The following are notes collected by the Dispatch Supervisor and Field Supervisors regarding the activities & effectiveness of the Emergency Medical Dispatch function at the event:

## Problems

* Dispatch Supervisor was not briefed on Communications Plan prior to event. Event radios were programmed with 3 medical channels, the intended use of which had not been communicated.
* Dispatch Supervisor was not briefed on Radio System functionality prior to event. It wasn't until the parade started & teams were in place did we find out that one of the two dispatch channels had limited coverage due to it not being a repeated channel.
* Dispatch staff was not pre-selected prior to event. Dispatch Supervisor pulled in outside resources for event.
* Dispatch was without team or call tracking facilities. We ended up using Post-It notes and paper maps.
* Dispatch was not briefed on radio protocol. There were several 'codes' in use by Pride Staff, none of which had been communicated to Dispatch staff.
* Dispatch was not provided a means for accepting and tracking calls from other agencies. Again, dispatch relied on Post-It Notes and slips of paper.
* The call responsibility area (box) was not communicated to Dispatch prior to event. Dispatch was unaware of where our call responsibility within the city lay.
* Dispatch was not provided with a disiaster plan.
* Dispatch was not provided with shut-down orders.
* Dispatch was not provided with relief staff.
* Dispatch was not provided with lunch.
* Medical Staff was not familiar with radio ediquite. Field Teams were too talkative, and were unfamiliar with ring-down techniques.
* Non-medical staff were advised to switch to the 'medical channel', when in need of medical assistance. Often this would lead to confusing & ambiguous calls as safety and other volunteers would switch to the 'medical channel', call for help, and switch back. This would also interrupt the normal flow of medical traffic between dispatch and teams as these non-medical volunteers were unfamiliar with our radio protocols (and basic radio ediquitte).
* Main Med radio role was not staffed. Often this would lead to field-teams sending ring-down reports to dispatch, which is both a waste of bandwidth and leaves the field hospital unprepared for inbound patients.

## Recommended Solutions

* Institute a dedicated Dispatch Corp. within Rock Medicine. Create a dedicated team of Dispatch & Communications techs who provided Dispatch and Radio Communications training to Rock Medicine Field Teams.
* Provide ongoing training in Radio Communications. As new volunteers come, and old volunteers leave, training in radio communications is essential to upholding skill level.
* Create the role of Communications Supervisor within Rock Medicine. In addition to the roles of Field Supervisor and Clinic Supervisor, the Communications Supervisor is responsible for the Emergency Medical Radio Communications traffic at an event. This includes reviewing the communications plan, testing equipment, and staffing dispatch functions, among others.
* Created dedicated dispatch and field-team channels. Keeping with the tradition of allowing non-medical staff to switch to the 'medical channel' to request help, the dispatch channel fills this role. To avoid confusion amongst field teams, and to elivate the load from non-medical staff traffic, create a dedicated 'tactical' channel for field teams.
* Create a dispatch call tracking application. This would allow both Rock Med and our served agencies to track and report on calls.
* Craete a 'board' for tracking field units. Knowing the location & availability of field teams is essential.
