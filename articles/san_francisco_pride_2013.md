# Overview

The following report was compiled using San Francisco Pride Parade 2013 dispatch notes. The purpose of this document is to socialize the scope & weight of providing Emergency Medical Services Dispatch at an event of this magnitude.

# Background

The San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration is a parade and festival held in San Francisco every June. Event organizers were anticipating a record 1.2 million attendees to 2013's Pride event, an increase of 200,000 from the four previous [years](http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/pride-party-is-prepared-for-record-attendance/Content?oid=2151877). 2013's attendance increase was primarily due to recent judiciary victories with the repeal of California's Proposition 8 (Prop. 8) and the unconstitutionality of the Federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in the days leading up Pride. Additionally, San Francisco was experiencing exceptionally warm summer weather the weekend of Pride.

Prior to 2013, Pride Emergency Medical Services were provided by volunteers, administered by the 'San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride Celebration Committee' and under their direct control. For 2013 HealthRIGHT360's Rock Medicine program was brought in to administer Emergency Medical Operations using a combination of their volunteers and existing Pride administration volunteers. Rock Med was selected because of its ability to provide Advanced Life Support field care without burdening the existing San Francisco County Emergency Medical System.

# Recommended Solutions

The following recommendations are based on analysis of the event based on Dispatch Supervisor Notes, interviews with Dispatch Staff, and interviews with Field supervisors. These recommendations are broken down into sections based on their scope.

## Communications Plan

* Develop & socialize the Event Communications Plan prior to the Event.

This recommendation stems from the fact that the event radios were programmed with 3 Medical Channels, the purpose and configuration of each was unknown to Dispatch Staff.

* Involve Dispatch Supervisor in Event Communications Coordination.

The Dispatch Supervisor should assist and advise in the development of the Event Communications Plan.

* Use standardized forms for the Event Communications Plan.

Use ICS' Incident Radio Communications Plan (ICS 205).

## Staffing

* Recruit and select Dispatch Staff prior to event.

This ensures that dispatch is properly staffed, compensated & relieved.

* Staff Dispatch in shifts.

Dispatch should be relieved in the same manner as Field and Clinic Staff.

## Radio Protocol

* Socialize radio protocols.

Radio usage, terminology and effective communication should be emphasized to all users.

* Socialize 'ring down' protocols.

Field Hospitals should be alerted of Inbound Patient Reports.

## Call Tracking

* Implement Call Tracking system.

Create a means of accepting & tracking calls, team status, and dispatch status.

## Team Tracking

* Implement Geo-tracking System for Field Teams.

Create a means of tracking the goe-spacial location of Field Teams.

## Area of Responsibility

* Socialize the Area of Responsibility for Field Team Response.

Ensure Dispatch Staff is aware of the area of responsibility for Field Teams.
