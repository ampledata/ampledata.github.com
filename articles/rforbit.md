# Radio Frequency Earth Observation

The options for space-based Earth Observation in the optical and radar bands is 
immense and constantly growing. From Tier 1 players like Maxar & Airbus, to the 
startup community of Planet, Umbra nd Capella, there's almost no where on Earth we
can't see. When it comes to things we can hear, the field is severely lacking.

The known commercial players in the Radio Frequency Earth Observation (RF-EO) space
are:

* Spire
* Hawkeye360
* Kerios
* Unseelabs

While it's possible there are non-commercial RF-EO capabilities, those our out of 
scope of this article at this time.

The canonical use-case for EO-RF is tracking maritime vessels using AIS transmitters.
Often these AIS transmissions can be intercepted terrestrially, but in the open 
ocean or within contested areas this capability is lacking or non-existent.
